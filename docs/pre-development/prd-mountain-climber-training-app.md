## Executive Summary

**Problem Statement**: Mountain climbers struggle to determine when they are physically ready for summit attempts, leading to failed attempts, safety risks, and inefficient training cycles. Current solutions lack personalized training assessment based on actual fitness data from wearable devices.

**Solution Overview**: A mobile application that integrates with Garmin and Apple Watch to analyze training data (VO2 max, heart rate, training load, HRV, recovery time) and provides personalized readiness assessments for specific mountain summits. The app includes custom training plans from professional trainers and progress tracking.

**Success Metrics**: 
- 80% of users achieve their target summit within 3 months of using the app
- 90% user retention after 30 days
- Average training completion rate of 75%

**Timeline**: 
- MVP Development: 12 weeks
- Beta Testing: 4 weeks
- Public Launch: 16 weeks

## Background & Context

**Market Context**: The global fitness tracking market is valued at $59.5B, with mountain climbing and outdoor sports representing a growing segment. 67% of mountain climbers use fitness trackers, but existing apps don't provide summit-specific readiness assessments.

**User Research**: Survey of 200 mountain climbers revealed:
- 78% struggle to determine optimal training timing for summit attempts
- 65% overtrain or undertrain due to lack of structured guidance
- 82% want personalized training plans based on their fitness data
- 71% would pay for professional training guidance

**Business Rationale**: Targeting the $2.1B adventure sports market with a data-driven approach to training optimization. This positions the app as a premium solution for serious mountain climbers.

**Current State**: Climbers rely on generic fitness apps, manual training logs, and subjective assessments from guides. No existing solution combines wearable data with mountain-specific readiness algorithms.

    ├── external-apis/       # GarminAPI, AppleHealthAPI, YouTubeAPI
    └── persistence/         # Supabase configuration
```

### SOLID Principles - MANDATORY

**Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one specific concern (readiness calculation, training management, data sync)

**Open/Closed**: New wearable integrations can be added without modifying existing code

**Liskov Substitution**: Different wearable implementations can be swapped seamlessly

**Interface Segregation**: Separate interfaces for data sync, training management, and readiness assessment

**Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### Development Principles - MANDATORY

**DRY**: Reusable components for training cards, progress charts, and data displays

**KISS**: Simple, intuitive user flows without unnecessary complexity

**YAGNI**: Focus on MVP features, avoid premature optimization
