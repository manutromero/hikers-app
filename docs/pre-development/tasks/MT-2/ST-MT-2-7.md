**Step-by-Step Implementation**:

1. **Enable RLS on All Tables**
   ```sql
   -- supabase/migrations/20240115000007_rls_policies.sql
   
   -- Enable RLS on user-specific tables
   ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE wearable_devices ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE wearable_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE training_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE training_plans ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE readiness_scores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE user_content ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   
   -- Enable RLS on system tables (admin access only)
   ALTER TABLE system_config ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **User Profiles Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Users can only access their own profile
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
   
   -- Users can update their own profile
   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles
       FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);
   
   -- Users can insert their own profile (during registration)
   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON user_profiles
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
   
   -- Users cannot delete their profile (handled by auth.users cascade)
   CREATE POLICY "Users cannot delete own profile" ON user_profiles
       FOR DELETE USING (false);
   ```

3. **Wearable Data Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Users can only access their own wearable devices
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own devices" ON wearable_devices
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can manage their own devices
   CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own devices" ON wearable_devices
       FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can only access their own wearable data
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own wearable data" ON wearable_data
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can insert their own wearable data
   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own wearable data" ON wearable_data
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can update their own wearable data
   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own wearable data" ON wearable_data
       FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

4. **Training Data Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Users can only access their own training sessions
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own training sessions" ON training_sessions
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can manage their own training sessions
   CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own training sessions" ON training_sessions
       FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can only access their own training plans
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own training plans" ON training_plans
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can manage their own training plans
   CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own training plans" ON training_plans
       FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

5. **Readiness Scores Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Users can only access their own readiness scores
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own readiness scores" ON readiness_scores
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can insert their own readiness scores
   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own readiness scores" ON readiness_scores
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can update their own readiness scores
   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own readiness scores" ON readiness_scores
       FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

6. **Content Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Users can only access their own content
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own content" ON user_content
       FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Users can manage their own content
   CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own content" ON user_content
       FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

7. **System Configuration Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Public read access for public configurations
   CREATE POLICY "Public can view public config" ON system_config
       FOR SELECT USING (is_public = true);
   
   -- Admin only access for private configurations
   CREATE POLICY "Admin can manage system config" ON system_config
       FOR ALL USING (
           EXISTS (
               SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
               WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
           )
       );
   ```

8. **Mountains Table (Public Read Access)**
   ```sql
   -- Mountains are public data, no RLS needed for read access
   -- But we can add policies for admin management
   CREATE POLICY "Admin can manage mountains" ON mountains
       FOR ALL USING (
           EXISTS (
               SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
               WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
           )
       );
   ```

9. **Create Security Functions**
   ```sql
   -- Function to check if user is admin
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin(user_id UUID)
   RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
   BEGIN
       RETURN EXISTS (
           SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
           WHERE id = user_id AND role = 'admin'
       );
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
   
   -- Function to get current user's data
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_current_user_data()
   RETURNS TABLE (
       user_id UUID,
       username VARCHAR(50),
       fitness_level VARCHAR(50)
   ) AS $$
   BEGIN
       RETURN QUERY
       SELECT 
           up.id,
           up.username,
           up.fitness_level
       FROM user_profiles up
       WHERE up.id = auth.uid();
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
   ```

**Key Implementation Details**:
- **Design Patterns**: Security pattern, access control pattern
- **Error Handling**: Security violation handling, access denied responses
- **Data Validation**: User ownership validation, permission checks
- **Performance Considerations**: Efficient policy evaluation, minimal overhead

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests**:
- [ ] RLS policy validation tests
- [ ] User access control tests
- [ ] Admin access control tests
- [ ] Security function tests

**Integration Tests**:
- [ ] Cross-user data access tests
- [ ] Admin privilege tests
- [ ] Policy enforcement tests

**Manual Testing Steps**:
1. Test user access to own data
2. Test user access to other users' data (should be denied)
3. Test admin access to system data
4. Test public data access
5. Verify policy enforcement in application

### Code Quality Standards
