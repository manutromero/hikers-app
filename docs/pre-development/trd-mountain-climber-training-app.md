## Executive Summary

**Technical Problem**: Mountain climbers need a mobile application that can integrate with wearable devices (Garmin, Apple Watch), analyze fitness data, and provide personalized summit readiness assessments. The system must handle real-time health data synchronization, video content delivery, and complex readiness algorithms while maintaining high performance and security standards.

**Solution Approach**: React Native mobile application with Expo managed workflow, Supabase backend for data storage and authentication, real-time wearable data integration, and YouTube API for training content delivery. The system implements hexagonal architecture with clean separation of concerns.

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- React Native with Expo for cross-platform development and rapid iteration
- Supabase for backend-as-a-service with real-time capabilities
- Hexagonal architecture for maintainable and testable codebase
